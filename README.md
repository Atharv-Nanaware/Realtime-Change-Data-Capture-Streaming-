In this Change Data Capturing Project, we dive deep into the world of Change Data Capture (CDC) and how it can be implemented for real-time data streaming using a powerful tech stack. We  will use the integration of technologies like Docker, Postgres, Debezium, Kafka, Apache Spark, and Slack to create an efficient and responsive data pipeline.

We will learn how to:

Configure and Save data into PostgreSQL database
Configure and capture changes on PostgreSQL with Debezium
Stream data into kafka
Add a streaming layer on top of kafka with Apache Spark, Flink, Storm or ksqlDB
